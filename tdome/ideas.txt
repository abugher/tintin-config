The patrol feature could be a daemon instead of a set of triggers.  Set
up a recursive alias with a switch statement

#alias {d} {
  #if {1 == $patrol} {
    #if {1 == $} {
      #map run {%1} {$step_time};
      #delay {$patrol_time} {
        #if {p1 == %1} {
          patrol_to {p2};
        };
        #elseif {p2 == %1} {
          patrol_to {p1};
        }
      };
    };
  };
};



Sleep may need to turn off patrol.  Oh, it does.  Seems racy, though.

Patrol needs to re-arm if patrol mode is off.


It might be about time to look at the big picture and refactor.  I think
I like the directory-per-feature scheme.  A lot of code could probably
be rewritten, too.

Add a delay to most of the prey items.  Omit the delay for higher
priority.  Maybe stagger a few different levels of delay.

This whole chain of actions thing seems like a fragile pattern.  See if
that can be traded out for the recursive pseudo-daemon or what.

Combat might be an OK application of some action triggers.  Not sure how
to say, "Stun whoever you're fighting," though.
